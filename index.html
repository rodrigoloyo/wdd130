  <h1>Elder Renlund's Quotes</h1>
  <p>“I recognized that this was dangerous,” Elder Renlund said. “I tried to compensate for it. I prayed and studied
    more.  But these things did not adequately compensate for missing the sacrament.” </p>
  <p><em>Increasing</em> faith in Jesus Christ through repentance .</p>
  <p> Spiritual <strong>“sisu”</strong> in that paragraph</p>
  <p>Elder Renlund described such determination using the Finnish word “sisu.” 
    The word is roughly translated into English as “stoic determination, 
    tenacity of purpose, resilience and hardiness.” </p>
