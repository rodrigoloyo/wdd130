  <p>In his Sept. 14 devotional address, Elder Renlund said lifelong conversion to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ
    requires “engaging with each element of the doctrine of Christ” and doing so with spiritual resilience, regardless
    of one’s circumstances. </p>
  <p>“To live happily ever after is not that <em>simple</em>,” Elder Renlund said. “But it is also not really that
   <em>complicated</em> either.”</p>
  <p>Spiritual <strong>“sisu”</strong> </p>
  <p>Elder Renlund described such determination using the Finnish word “sisu.”
    The word is roughly translated into English as “stoic determination,
    tenacity of purpose, resilience and hardiness.” </p>

  <p>In summary:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Enduring to the end</li>
    <li>Partaking of the sacrament</li>
    <li>Increasing faith in Jesus Christ through repentance </li>
    <li>Spiritual “sisu”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Repentence steps</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Faith to rely on the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</li>
    <li>Sorrow for committing the sin</li>
    <li>Confession. </li>
    <li>Abandonment of sin</li>
    <li>Restitution</li>
    <li>Righteous living</li>
  </ol>
